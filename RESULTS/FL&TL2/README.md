# SIMULATION
Here are contained the comparison plots and the aggregated model data.

The data_*.png files show the drawings of the aggregated dataset.

The dec_bound_*.png files show the drawings of the final decision boundaries obtained by the model on the train set.

The *.dat files show the numbers from which the aggregated learning curves are plotted.

Here are also shown the reduced plots containing all the others equivalent FL simulations.
